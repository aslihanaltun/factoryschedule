# factoryschedule

This program aimed to scheduling machine works with most efficient order according to operation type, set up duration between operation type change, orders. There are 3 different inputs which are operation types, set up durations, orders which are in random order. Operations input contains operation code and speed of machine on that operation type(amount per minute). Second input contains machine's set up durations when two orders in a row have different operation types. So if machine has to do two different type of operations, then machine has to wait for set up period for given duration between these two operations. Orders input contains followed subinputs in given order; order code, amount of work, operation code and deadline duration. This program will schedule given orders in most efficient way and print it in "schedule.txt" file. Schedule will contain five outputs in given order; starting time(that will show duration between start time of machine work and start time of given order), operation code of order, order code, amount of work, set up duration.
