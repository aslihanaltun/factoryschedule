# factoryschedule

This program aimed to schedule machine works with the most efficient order according to operation type, set up duration between operation type change, orders. There are 3 different inputs which are operation types, set up durations, orders which are in random order. Operations input contains operation code and speed of machine on that operation type(amount per minute). The second input contains machine's set up durations when two orders in a row have different operation types. So if machine has to do two different types of operations, then machine has to wait for the set up period for given duration between these two operations. Orders input contains followed sub inputs in the given order; order code, amount of work, operation code, and deadline duration. This program will schedule given orders in most efficient way and print them in "schedule.txt" file. The schedule will contain five outputs in given order; starting time(that will show duration between the start time of machine work and start time of given order), operation code of order, order code, amount of work, set up duration.
